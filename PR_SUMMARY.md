## How to Use BookBot AI

### Search Engine

1. **Basic Search**:
   - Enter your search query in the search box at the top of the page
   - Click the "Search" button or press Enter
   - Results will display below, showing book covers, titles, and authors
   - If no results are found, a message will be displayed

2. **Search Tips**:
   - For best results, use specific terms (e.g., "Harry Potter" instead of just "magic")
   - Include author names for author-specific searches (e.g., "J.K. Rowling")
   - Include genre terms for genre-specific searches (e.g., "fantasy novels")
   - The search engine searches across titles, authors, and book descriptions

### Chatbot

   - Scroll down to the "Chat with BookBot AI" section
